    "In the data file you will find training data and labels. The data are bandpower time series in 192 dimensions (electrodes). The labels are 2 dimensional hand positions measured with a motion capture system. You will also find test data, for which no labels will be provided. The data loading routine already does the log-transform of the bandpower data, so you can just go ahead and compute the Ordinary Least Squares solution. "
